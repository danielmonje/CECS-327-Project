# CECS-327-Project Write-up

Jonathan
Planning stages worked fine until out of nowhere we were down a teammate due to him dropping the class. We originally thought we would use Python for this class but decided on something different with Node Js. A language specifically made to work on its own with Javascript but without the need for browser in the front-end; not that it couldn't be implemented with it. The first few parts were implemented without much issue but the connection handling, file load and syncing became an issue. File loading worked and connection handling worked but for syncing we ran out of time. As well as, connection handling without hardcoded pathing. 
Project topic was interesting but developing this was a challenge seeing that it was a first for either of us. Attempted to work with UDP datagrams, html as a front-end and TCP. TCP was used in the end; I could not figure out how UDP library worked and the reliability of transfer bothered me. HTML as a front-end would have been interesting to implement but could not give enough time to testing this potential idea.
